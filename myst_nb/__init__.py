    Parameters
    ----------
    name: string
        A unique name for the variable. You can use this name to refer to the variable
        later on.
    variable: Python object
        A variable in Python for which you'd like to store its display value. This is
        not quite the same as storing the object itself - the stored information is
        what is *displayed* when you print or show the object in a Jupyter Notebook.
    display: bool
        Display the object you are gluing. This is helpful in sanity-checking the
        state of the object at glue-time.
