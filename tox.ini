# To use tox, see https://tox.readthedocs.io
# Simply pip or conda install tox
# If you use conda, you may also want to install tox-conda
# then run `tox` or `tox -- {pytest args}`
# To run in parallel using `tox -p` (this does not appear to work for this repo)

# To rebuild the tox environment, for example when dependencies change, use
# `tox -r`

# Note: if the following error is encountered: `ImportError while loading conftest`
# then then deleting compiled files has been found to fix it: `find . -name \*.pyc -delete`
